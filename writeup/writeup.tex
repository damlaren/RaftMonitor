ABSTRACT

\end{abstract} 

\section{Introduction}

basic description of system (maybe 1/2 page)

\section{Simulating Partitions}

concepts for simulating partitions, sniffing packets
- iptables and packet redirection
- sniffing with libtins

\section{System Overview}

discussion of different modules in system, and how we support adaptation for different raft implementations

- test driver (glue that holds everything together)
- setup scripting
- the monitor/sniffer module
- the Client API
-- API functions to read/write using a specific Raft implementation
-- system-wide API also getting tucked in here
-- (The Client API will probably be renamed to something else to better reflect its meaning-- something like an ``Adaptation Layer'')
- teardown, if it's worth it

\subsection{Future Work}

- plans for additional checkers for more raft implementations
- more functionality in monitors? delaying or blocking packets

\section{Tests}

discussion of tests supported by the system:
- basic sanity check (client does op expected to succeed)
- multiple clients writing to file system
- failure and restart of raft nodes
- partitions

\subsection{Future Work}

additional tests we plan to do or didn't get to
