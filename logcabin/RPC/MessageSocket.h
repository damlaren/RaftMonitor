 * A MessageSocket is a message-oriented layer on top of a TCP connection.
 * It sends and receives discrete chunks of data identified by opaque IDs.
 * Higher layers can use this to build an RPC framework, both on the client
 * side and on the server side.
 *
 * On the wire, this adds a 12-byte header on all messages. The first 8 bytes,
 * encoded as an integer in big endian, are the message ID. The next 4 bytes,
 * encoded as an integer in big endian, are the number of bytes of data
 * following the header. Following the header, the data is sent as an opaque
 * binary string.
 *
 * TODO(ongaro): There are probably two things missing from this header. First,
 * it should have some mechanism (such as a version field) for changing the
 * header format later. Second, it should have a checksum, as the
 * TCP/IP/Ethernet checksums may not be sufficient.
